    Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2 <= a <= 5 and 2 <= b <= 5:
    2^2 = 4     2^3 = 8     2^4 = 16    2^5 = 32
    3^2 = 9     3^3 = 27    3^4 = 81    3^5 = 243
    4^2 = 16    4^3 = 64    4^4 = 256   4^5 = 1024
    5^2 = 25    5^3 = 125   5^4 = 625   5^5 = 3125
    If they are placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the 
    following sequence of 15 distinct terms:
    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125
    How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for
    2 <= a <= 100 and 2 <= b <= 100? */

        outcome *= a;

    // of both a and b,
