## Problem 001: Multiples of 3 or 5
*If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$. Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.*

First note that

$$
3+6+9+\dots=3(1+2+3+\dots)
$$

and

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{k}n=\frac{1}{2}k(k+1).
$$

The same logic can be applied to the multiples of $5$. The problem can be effectively solved in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ by only computing the whole number part of the quotient. Caution must be taken, as multiples of $15$ will be double-counted.
```js
function solution(n) {
    const highest3 = Math.floor((n - 1) / 3);
    const sum3 = 3 * ((highest3 * (highest3 + 1)) / 2);


    const highest5 = Math.floor((n - 1) / 5);
    const sum5 = 5 * ((highest5 * (highest5 + 1)) / 2);

    const highest15 = Math.floor((number - 1) / 15);
    const sum15 = 15 * ((highest15 * (highest15 + 1)) / 2);

    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15;
}
```

## Problem 002:
*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:*

*$$
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\dots
$$*

*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*

The typical way of computing the Fibonacci sequence is via recursion (as it is usually first taught.) However, this is computationally expensive (runs in $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$ time.) Perhaps a faster way to compute the sequence is by storing an array/list of three numbers

$$
[1,1,2]
$$

and effectively shifting and computing each successive term. Thus, computing the $n$th Fibonacci term only takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.

Further research shows that there exists a recurrence relation betweeen the even Fibonacci numbers. Let the even sequence be represented as $E(n)$. Then,

$$
E(n)=4E(n-1)+E(n-2)
$$

Using this recurrence relation optimises the computation of Fibonacci terms (as now it only involves every third term in the sequence).
```js
function solution(n) {
	let fibTerms = [0, 0, 2];
    let sumEven = 0;

    while (fibTerms[2] <= n) {
        sumEven += fibTerms[2];

        fibTerms[0] = fibTerms[1];
        fibTerms[1] = fibTerms[2];
        fibTerms[2] = 4 * fibTerms[1] + fibTerms[0];
    }
    
	return sumEven;
}
```
*Note: The Python approach does not need to involve a list; inline variable swapping can be performed instead.*

## Problem 003: Largest Prime Factor
*The prime factors of $13195$ are $5, 7, 13$ and $29$. What is the largest prime factor of $600851475143$?*

Start by dividing the input number by $2$, and repeatedly divide it by increasing prime numbers. For optimisation, instead of counting up manually, we can generate primes in the form $6k\pm1$ instead. We can still use this form even if it yields a composite number (e.g. $k=20,\therefore 6k+1=121=11^{2}$). This is because new composite numbers generated consist of smaller primes, which would have already been divided out previously.  Instead of checking up until the input number, we can effectively stop at its square root. 

```js
function solution(number) {
    let largestPrime = 1;

    while (number % 2 == 0) {
        largestPrime = 2;
        number /= 2;
    }

    while (number % 3 == 0) {
        largestPrime = 3;
        number /= 3;
    }


    for (let m = 5; (m * m) <= number; m += 6) {
        while (number % m == 0) {
            largestPrime = m;
            number /= m;
        }

        while (number % (m + 2) == 0) {
            largestPrime = m + 2;
            number /= (m + 2);
        }
    }

    if (n > 4) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return largestPrime;
	}
}
```
