## Problem 001: Multiples of 3 or 5
*If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$. Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.*

First note that

$$
3+6+9+\dots=3(1+2+3+\dots)
$$

and

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{k}n=\frac{1}{2}k(k+1).
$$

The same logic can be applied to the multiples of $5$. The problem can be effectively solved in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ by only computing the whole number part of the quotient. Caution must be taken, as multiples of $15$ will be double-counted.
```js
function solution(n) {
    const highest3 = Math.floor((n - 1) / 3);
    const sum3 = 3 * ((highest3 * (highest3 + 1)) / 2);


    const highest5 = Math.floor((n - 1) / 5);
    const sum5 = 5 * ((highest5 * (highest5 + 1)) / 2);

    const highest15 = Math.floor((number - 1) / 15);
    const sum15 = 15 * ((highest15 * (highest15 + 1)) / 2);

    return sum3 + sum5 - sum15;
}
```

## Problem 002:
*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:*

*$$
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,\dots
$$*

*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*

The typical way of computing the Fibonacci sequence is via recursion (as it is usually first taught.) However, this is computationally expensive (runs in $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$ time.) Perhaps a faster way to compute the sequence is by storing an array/list of three numbers

$$
[1,1,2]
$$

and effectively shifting and computing each successive term. Thus, computing the $n$th Fibonacci term only takes $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time.

Further research shows that there exists a recurrence relation betweeen the even Fibonacci numbers. Let the even sequence be represented as $E(n)$. Then,

$$
E(n)=4E(n-1)+E(n-2)
$$

Using this recurrence relation optimises the computation of Fibonacci terms (as now it only involves every third term in the sequence).
```js
function solution(n) {
	let fibTerms = [0, 0, 2];
    let sumEven = 0;

    while (fibTerms[2] <= n) {
        sumEven += fibTerms[2];

        fibTerms[0] = fibTerms[1];
        fibTerms[1] = fibTerms[2];
        fibTerms[2] = 4 * fibTerms[1] + fibTerms[0];
    }
    
	return sumEven;
}
```
*Note: The Python approach does not need to involve a list; inline variable swapping can be performed instead.*
