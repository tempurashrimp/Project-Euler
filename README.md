# Project Euler
---
My solutions to Project Euler problems, in three languages (JavaScript, Python and C++).
Markdown files contain thought process and external links for further reading.
The purpose of this repo is not just to provide solutions, but also to document my learning
as I solve these problems.

To read my thinking process/working, please refer to the "method" folder.
